## Background

[Master Mind](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>) was a game I played when I was a kid and I really enjoyed it.
So I build a website game that follows the same rules. The basic idea is you are trying to guess the color combination of the hidden code.

How to play

- Make a guess by dragging the colors the in the input box
- After hitting `Add Color ` you will receive your clues, a white peg or a black peg
- White means right color wrong space
- Black means right color right space
